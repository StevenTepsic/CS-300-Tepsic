In this course we discovered how different search algorithms and data structures impacted program performance. The projects were to test the effects.

I approached the problem by comparing the complexity of creating the different structures along with the complexity of sorting and displaying them.
For exampel some data structures were simple to sort and search through, but were too complex in creation. Due to a low number of inputs the simpler code ended up being most efficient.

Most of the roadblocks encountered were overcome by comparing the code I was struggling with to other example, whether they were examples from the text or segments of code from previous assignments.

This project explaned my approach to software design by causing me to be more intentional with how I store and access data.

This project has evolved the way I write code, mainly in the modularity of it.
Working with the different search algorithms has shown me the benifit of being able to use code you already wrote on other programs.
